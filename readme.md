# Homework Assignments

Hi,
I'm Eksapsy, or Apostolis Anastasiou which is harder to say.

This repository is dedicated to homework assignments for Pirple. If you don't know Pirple you should check it out.

It's a **MasterClass** dedicated to **NodeJS**, with its purpose for you to learn how to right better NodeJS programs and to learn how NodeJS works in the background - **without installing ANY NPM modules!**

The target is to make a NodeJS full API without having a single **NPM Package** installed and without the use of **package.json**.

You can find my assignments in numerical order in the folders of this Git Repository.
